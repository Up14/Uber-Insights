# Uber-Insights


Objective:
The aim is to assess ride-hailing services (Uber, Rapido, and Ola), identify any shortcomings in their features, and develop strategies to improve user experience and retention, especially for cost-conscious users.

Key Activities and Findings:

1. Evaluation of Ride-Hailing Services:
 Services Analyzed: Uber, Rapido, and Ola.
 Feature Gaps and Areas for Improvement: A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify specific areas where each service lags behind its competitors.
 NOISE Analysis: A detailed NOISE (Needs, Opportunities, Improvements, Strengths, and Exceptions) analysis was performed to pinpoint critical areas for improvement.

2. User Journey Mapping:
Surveys Conducted: Engaged over 50 users through detailed surveys.
Journey Mapping: Mapped the entire user journey from booking a ride to completion, identifying key touchpoints and user interactions.
Pain Points: Common issues such as booking delays, ride cancellations, fare disputes, and driver communication problems were highlighted.
User Attrition Analysis: Investigated the main reasons for user attrition, including price sensitivity, service reliability, and app usability.

3. Feature Proposals:
New Features: Proposed new features to address identified pain points and improve user satisfaction.
Price-Sensitive User Retention: Focused on features to retain price-sensitive users with the goal of increasing retention by 10%.
CRR Metrics: Developed Customer Retention Rate (CRR) metrics to measure the impact of the new features and overall user satisfaction.

4. High-Fidelity Wireframes:
Wireframe Creation: Designed high-fidelity wireframes for the proposed new features to visually represent the enhanced user interface and user experience.
User Feedback: Incorporated feedback from initial user surveys to refine wireframes and align them with user expectations.

5. Go-To-Market Strategy:
Market Analysis: Conducted a thorough market analysis to understand competitive dynamics, market trends, and user preferences.
Targeted Marketing Plans: Developed targeted marketing plans to effectively reach and engage price-sensitive users, leveraging data-driven insights and user personas.
Implementation Roadmap: Created an implementation roadmap outlining key milestones, timelines, and resource allocation for the successful rollout of new features.

Outcome:
The Uber Insights project provided a detailed evaluation of ride-hailing services, identified areas for improvement, and proposed strategic enhancements to increase user retention, particularly among price-sensitive users. The high-fidelity wireframes and go-to-market strategy ensure a structured and user-centric approach to implementing the proposed features.
